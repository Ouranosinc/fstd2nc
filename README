This is an interface for reading RPN files from the PyGeode framework.

For information on PyGeode, see http://sparc01.atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca/pygeode/docs/

The RPN format is a binary format used internally at Environment Canada, so
it's probably of limited use to other people.  I'm sharing it on a public
repository just in case anyone else have these files, and wants to read them.

Note that this isn't an official interface.  I created it based on a few
sample files I had lying around.  It may not be 100% compatible with all RPN
files.
