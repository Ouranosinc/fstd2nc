Version 0.7.1 (Jun 6, 2013)
	* Bug fix - coordinate variables should be distinguished by ip1,ip2,ip3
	  values (in addition to usual unique attributes).

Version 0.7.0 (May 28, 2013)
	* Add rudimentary support for '!!' vertical record.  No vertical
	  information is extracted beyond the 'zeta' values, though.
	* Fix the z-axis order.  Depending on the order of output for the
	  GEM model, the default order of records may not be adequate.

Version 0.6.1 (Feb 11, 2013)
	* Fixed bug in attaching latitude/longitude fields.  LAM/rotated grids
	  did not have coordinate information, due to a kludging of the ip2
	  value when using squash_forecasts flag.

Version 0.6.0 (Feb 6, 2013)
	* Push the --squash-forecast option deeper into the code, to avoid
	  triggering time/forecast assertions that are no longer applicable.
	* Factor out the code for decoding the time axis.
	* Don't use the IP2 value from the file.  Instead, regenerate a
	  "proper" IP2 from DEET/NPAS.

Version 0.5.0 (Jan 11, 2013)
	* Some support for reading compressed fields (datyp=133).
	* Option in rpn2nc to squash the forecast axis into the time axis.

Version 0.4.2 (Jan 7, 2013):
	* Minor bug fix in "p2ll" function - return statement was missing.

Version 0.4.1 (Jan 7, 2013):
	* Minor bug fix in geophy.

Version 0.4.0 (Jan 7, 2013):
	* Add support for GEM geophy binary files.
	* Adjust date to be date of analysis, not date of validity.
	* Support for multiple forecast hours in the same file.
	* Allow for negative forecast hours.

Version 0.3.1 (July 20, 2012):
	* Fix bug with RPN date stamps.  Need to use floating-point during the
	  conversion, or we can't resolve time intervals less than an hour.

Version 0.3.0 (July 3, 2012):
	* Some minor code cleanup.
	* Interface for raw 'BMF' files used by the GEM model.

Version 0.2.0 (May 14, 2012):
	* Low-level file I/O routines updated / validated against the actual
	  RPN file interface.
	* Fixed bug in decoding R32 fields (packed 32-bit).
	* Some support for rotated (E) grids.
	* A new script to convert from RPN files to netCDF (rpn2nc).

Version 0.1.0 (May 9, 2012):
	* Initial version.
	* Works on global uniform (unrotated) grid files.
	* Some support for polar stereographic grids.
