Version 0.20180220.0 (Feb 20, 2017)
	* Improvements to xarray interface to utilize the CF conventions
	  metadata (such as auxiliary coordinates).
	* Add station, leadtime, and reftime as auxiliary coordinates in series
	  files.
	* Use the date of validity by default.  Old behaviour (date of origin)
	  can be restored by using --dateo or --forecast-axis options.
	* Added 'leadtime' and 'reftime' auxiliary coordinates to encode the
	  forecast information.
	* Progress bar is enabled by default.  Can be turned off with
	  --no-progress option.
	* Added CF metadata for various grid projections (rotated pole, polar
	  stereographic, lat-lon).
	* Decode surface types (ice, land, sea, etc.).
	* Decode depth coordinate for ocean model output.
	* Fix decoding of masked data in raw binary (X32) format.

Version 0.20171130.1 (Feb 13, 2017)
	* Fixed unlimited dimension specification for PyDAP interface.
	* Workaround for bug in numpy 1.14 when using masked structured arrays.
	* Fix forecast times for series files.
	* Don't discard LA/LO fields.  They needed in some circumstances such
	  as trajectory files.

Version 0.20171130.0 (Nov 30, 2017)
	* Faster scanning of input file headers.
	* New --progress option to show a progress bar for long conversions.
	* More speed optimizations for RPN date and IP1 value conversions.
	* Faster determination of dimensions from the record headers, using
	  pandas package.
	* Restructured the package so each feature is in a separate Python
	  module, for easier development.
	* Added xarray interface to facilitate custom netCDF conversions from
	  Python.

Version 0.20171103.0 (Nov 3, 2017)
	* Faster I/O when converting multiple input files.

Version 0.20170922.0 (Sep 22, 2017)
	* Support for ''scale_factor'' and ''offset'' attributes in metadata
	  files, as a rudimentary form of unit conversion.
	* New --zlib option for compression of netCDF files.
	* Some speed optimizations for converting to netCDF4:
	  - Chunk size is set equal to FSTD record size.
	  - FSTD records are read in order, to better utilize buffering /
	    read-ahead on the input file(s).

Version 0.20170908.0 (Sep 8, 2017)
	* ''station_id'' axis for series files.
	* Allow --squash-forecasts to work on series data (only with one date
	  of origin).
	* New --subgrid-axis option for splitting supergrids (e.g. yinyang)
	  into multiple sub-grids that are aligned on a ''subgrid'' axis.
	* Experimental [https://github.com/pydap/pydap pydap] plugin for
	  browsing FSTD files through a web interface.  To test it:
	  python -m pydap.wsgi.app
	* Allow directory names and wildcard patterns (surrounded by quotes)
	  as inputs to the converter.
	* Speed optimizations for RPN date and IP1 value conversions.
	* Speed optimizations for data type detection (dtype_fst2numpy).
	* Speed optimizations for --filter option
	* Experimental (and undocumented) --quick-scan option to quickly
	  extract record headers from input files.  Gives a good speed boost
	  when reading many input files, but relies on some internal structures 
	  of librmn.
	* New --msglvl option to control verbosity of librmn messages.
	  Default is changed to display only warning / error.  Old behaviour
	  can be restored by using --msglvl=INFORM.

Version 0.20170728 (Jul 28, 2017)
	* Make ''time'' dimension unlimited in the netCDF file.
	* New --nc-format parameter to control the type of netCDF file being
	  created.
	* Verify input file(s) are RPN files before trying to convert them.
	* New --force option to overwrite the netCDF file if it already exists.
	* New --filter option to select records based on some criteria
	  (e.g. "--filter ip1==24" to select 24-hour forecasts only).
	* Some decoding of vertical coordinate for series data.
	* Make sure nomvars are valid netCDF variable names, otherwise prepend
	  an underscore to them so the netCDF library doesn't complain.
	* Remove degenerate ni/nj axes from the output file, and remove
	  degenerate time axes which contain dummy RPN dates.
	* Support for 'U' grids ("supergrids").

Version 0.20170712.1 (Jul 13, 2017)
	* Bug fix for station name decoding (series files).
	* New --metadata-file option for adding arbitrary metadata to the
	  netCDF file.
	* Wrap all messages with gettext, to facilitate translation to French.  
	  Note: no actual translations done yet.
	* New --minimal-metadata option to strip out FSTD-specific metadata
	  from the netCDF file (such as kind, datyp, npas, etc.).
	* Support for multiple input files.
	* Write the command invocation into a global "history" attribute of
	  the netCDF file.  Can be disabled by new option --no-history.
	* When fudging variable names to make them unique in the output file,
	  use more context-specific modifiers such as etiket, typvar, etc.
	  instead of an integer counter.
	* Warn when variable / dimension names have to be modified.
	* New --ignore-typvar option to allow records with different typvars
	  to be combined into a single variable.
	* New --reference-date option to control the reference date of the
	  time axis.

Version 0.20170427 (Apr 28, 2017)
	* Check if netCDF output file already exists, and prompt the user
	  before overwriting.
	* Check if input file exists before trying to convert it.
	* Some support for series files.
	* Some more metadata for identifying horizontal and time dimensions.
	* Some support for masked data.  Detects records that have an '@' in
	  their typvar, and looks for a corresponding mask record (typvar='@@').
	* New --ignore-etiket option to allow records with different etikets
	  to be combined into a single output variable.
