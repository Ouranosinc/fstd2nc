Version 0.20180423.0 (Apr 23, 2018)
	* New --rpnstd-metadata-list to select a subset of RPN metadata
	  attributes to copy to the netCDF file.
	* Made --minimal-metadata the default.  The old behaviour (copying all
	  RPN metadata) can be triggered with a new --rpnstd-metadata option.
	* Coordinate-related RPN metadata is no longer copied, since the values
	  are already encoded in the coordinate variable.
	* Restored support for 'A', 'B', and 'G' grids.
	* Fixed the repeated longitude in global grids - value is now 360
	  instead of wrapping back to 0.
	* Use consistent lat/lon/station coordinates for series data when using
	  a --filter on the ip3 values.
	* Unused axes are now pruned from the file.  Mostly affected series
	  files, which had an extra time axis from the unused datev values.
	* Vertical axes are now encoded as floats, since that's the precision
	  of the original ip1 values.  The pandas version of the iterator was
	  upconverting these to doubles, which would cause different results
	  depending on whether pandas was installed or not.

Version 0.20180220.0 (Feb 20, 2018)
	* Improvements to xarray interface to utilize the CF conventions
	  metadata (such as auxiliary coordinates).
	* Add station, leadtime, and reftime as auxiliary coordinates in series
	  files.
	* Use the date of validity by default.  Old behaviour (date of origin)
	  can be restored by using --dateo or --forecast-axis options.
	* Added 'leadtime' and 'reftime' auxiliary coordinates to encode the
	  forecast information.
	* Progress bar is enabled by default.  Can be turned off with
	  --no-progress option.
	* Added CF metadata for various grid projections (rotated pole, polar
	  stereographic, lat-lon).
	* Decode surface types (ice, land, sea, etc.).
	* Decode depth coordinate for ocean model output.
	* Fix decoding of masked data in raw binary (X32) format.

Version 0.20171130.1 (Feb 13, 2018)
	* Fixed unlimited dimension specification for PyDAP interface.
	* Workaround for bug in numpy 1.14 when using masked structured arrays.
	* Fix forecast times for series files.
	* Don't discard LA/LO fields.  They needed in some circumstances such
	  as trajectory files.

Version 0.20171130.0 (Nov 30, 2017)
	* Faster scanning of input file headers.
	* New --progress option to show a progress bar for long conversions.
	* More speed optimizations for RPN date and IP1 value conversions.
	* Faster determination of dimensions from the record headers, using
	  pandas package.
	* Restructured the package so each feature is in a separate Python
	  module, for easier development.
	* Added xarray interface to facilitate custom netCDF conversions from
	  Python.

Version 0.20171103.0 (Nov 3, 2017)
	* Faster I/O when converting multiple input files.

Version 0.20170922.0 (Sep 22, 2017)
	* Support for ''scale_factor'' and ''offset'' attributes in metadata
	  files, as a rudimentary form of unit conversion.
	* New --zlib option for compression of netCDF files.
	* Some speed optimizations for converting to netCDF4:
	  - Chunk size is set equal to FSTD record size.
	  - FSTD records are read in order, to better utilize buffering /
	    read-ahead on the input file(s).

Version 0.20170908.0 (Sep 8, 2017)
	* ''station_id'' axis for series files.
	* Allow --squash-forecasts to work on series data (only with one date
	  of origin).
	* New --subgrid-axis option for splitting supergrids (e.g. yinyang)
	  into multiple sub-grids that are aligned on a ''subgrid'' axis.
	* Experimental [https://github.com/pydap/pydap pydap] plugin for
	  browsing FSTD files through a web interface.  To test it:
	  python -m pydap.wsgi.app
	* Allow directory names and wildcard patterns (surrounded by quotes)
	  as inputs to the converter.
	* Speed optimizations for RPN date and IP1 value conversions.
	* Speed optimizations for data type detection (dtype_fst2numpy).
	* Speed optimizations for --filter option
	* Experimental (and undocumented) --quick-scan option to quickly
	  extract record headers from input files.  Gives a good speed boost
	  when reading many input files, but relies on some internal structures 
	  of librmn.
	* New --msglvl option to control verbosity of librmn messages.
	  Default is changed to display only warning / error.  Old behaviour
	  can be restored by using --msglvl=INFORM.

Version 0.20170728 (Jul 28, 2017)
	* Make ''time'' dimension unlimited in the netCDF file.
	* New --nc-format parameter to control the type of netCDF file being
	  created.
	* Verify input file(s) are RPN files before trying to convert them.
	* New --force option to overwrite the netCDF file if it already exists.
	* New --filter option to select records based on some criteria
	  (e.g. "--filter ip1==24" to select 24-hour forecasts only).
	* Some decoding of vertical coordinate for series data.
	* Make sure nomvars are valid netCDF variable names, otherwise prepend
	  an underscore to them so the netCDF library doesn't complain.
	* Remove degenerate ni/nj axes from the output file, and remove
	  degenerate time axes which contain dummy RPN dates.
	* Support for 'U' grids ("supergrids").

Version 0.20170712.1 (Jul 13, 2017)
	* Bug fix for station name decoding (series files).
	* New --metadata-file option for adding arbitrary metadata to the
	  netCDF file.
	* Wrap all messages with gettext, to facilitate translation to French.  
	  Note: no actual translations done yet.
	* New --minimal-metadata option to strip out FSTD-specific metadata
	  from the netCDF file (such as kind, datyp, npas, etc.).
	* Support for multiple input files.
	* Write the command invocation into a global "history" attribute of
	  the netCDF file.  Can be disabled by new option --no-history.
	* When fudging variable names to make them unique in the output file,
	  use more context-specific modifiers such as etiket, typvar, etc.
	  instead of an integer counter.
	* Warn when variable / dimension names have to be modified.
	* New --ignore-typvar option to allow records with different typvars
	  to be combined into a single variable.
	* New --reference-date option to control the reference date of the
	  time axis.

Version 0.20170427 (Apr 28, 2017)
	* Check if netCDF output file already exists, and prompt the user
	  before overwriting.
	* Check if input file exists before trying to convert it.
	* Some support for series files.
	* Some more metadata for identifying horizontal and time dimensions.
	* Some support for masked data.  Detects records that have an '@' in
	  their typvar, and looks for a corresponding mask record (typvar='@@').
	* New --ignore-etiket option to allow records with different etikets
	  to be combined into a single output variable.
